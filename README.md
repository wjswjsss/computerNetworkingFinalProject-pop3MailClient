This is the final project of the Computer Networking Course @ NEU (China)

I implemented a very very simple mail client (for Tencent QQ mail users), which is able to
- login
- list the mail received (all at once / "laod more" 20 new per each)
- local preview / open in browser
- send email
- search by date / keyword (case unsensitive)
- VERY VERY SIMPLE GUI

How2run: just do `python ./path/to/the/gui_app.py` and if any error of "module not found", do `pip install {name of the module}` sometimes `{name of the module}` in the pip cmd is different from it in the error report, should ask LLMs to get the correct pip cmd :(

Comment: Theory was done last semester, but final project this semester .. tf
