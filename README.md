This is the final project of the Computer Networking Course @ NEU (China)

I implemented a very very simple mail client (for Tencent QQ mail users), which is able to
- login
- list the mail received (all at once / "laod more" 20 new per each)
- local preview / open in browser
- send email
- search by date / keyword (case unsensitive)
- VERY VERY SIMPLE GUI

Comment: Theory was done last semester, but final project this semester .. tf
